## Project Walkthrough
### Setup
on the file *layout.tsx* you have the object

```ts
export const MintbaseWalletSetup  = {
	contractAddress:  "test122212.mintspace2.testnet",
	network:  "testnet",
	callbackUrl:  "http://testnet.localhost:3000/",
};
```
where contractAddress is the address of a store that you are a minter.
if you dont have a store you can [deploy a new contract](https://www.mintbase.xyz/launchpad/contracts/0) on our launchpad

after that you can run
```
pnpm install
```
and 

```
pnpm dev
```
