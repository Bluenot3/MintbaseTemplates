## Minter

**DEMO:** https://examples.mintbase.xyz/minter

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/tree/main/minter) [![Edit on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Mintbase/examples/tree/main/minter)


This is a simple minter example built on top of **Next.js 14** using some of [@mintbase-js](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js) packages:

- [@mintbase.js/sdk](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js/tree/beta/packages/sdk): to use the execute call when minting

- [@mintbase.js/react](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js/tree/beta/packages/react) to provide the wallet connection

- [@mintbase.js/storage](https://github.com/Mintbase/mintbase-js/tree/beta/packages/sdk): to upload the images to Arweave

  
### Setup
on the file *layout.tsx* you have the object

```ts
export const MintbaseWalletSetup  = {
	contractAddress:  "test122212.mintspace2.testnet",
	network:  "testnet",
	callbackUrl:  "http://testnet.localhost:3000/",
};
```
where contractAddress is the address of a store that you are a minter.
if you dont have a store you can [deploy a new contract](https://www.mintbase.xyz/launchpad/contracts/0) on our launchpad

after that you can run
```
pnpm install
```
and 

```
pnpm dev
```
