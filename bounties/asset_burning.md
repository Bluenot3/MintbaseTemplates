# On-Chain Rewards System for Asset Burning

## Overview
Burning is the act of permanantly destroying digital assets. It enables brands to provide enaging experiences and projects to increase the value of their collections. Burning can also be used for commercial applications like ticketing, loyalty, trials, and coupons.

We're seeking a skilled developer or team to create a decentralized application (DApp) on the NEAR Protocol, facilitating an innovative on-chain rewards system. This DApp will enable users to burn their assets, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), in exchange for unique rewards. The mechanics of the burn-to-reward process can be flexible, ranging from direct asset burning with subsequent reward eligibility to more complex interactions involving UI elements and automated background processes.


## Functionality

### NFT Collection Integration: 
The DApp will allow NFT collection owners to integrate their existing collections into the platform. This will be achieved through a straightforward configuration process, where the collection owner specifies the smart contract address of their NFT collection.

### Configurable Rewards System:
 Collection owners can configure rewards for burning NFTs from their collection. This could include:

### Direct Rewards:
 Immediate rewards in the form of fungible tokens (FTs), other NFTs, or access to exclusive content/services.
Points System: Accumulation of points for each NFT burned, which can be redeemed for rewards at a later stage.
Tiered Rewards: Different levels of rewards based on the rarity or specific attributes of the burned NFT.
Dynamic Reward Pool Management: An interface for collection owners to manage and update the reward pool. This includes adding new rewards, adjusting reward quantities, and setting expiration dates for redeeming rewards.

### Smart Contract for Asset Burning:
 A secure, auditable smart contract that handles the burning of NFTs and the issuance of rewards. This contract will:

Verify the ownership of the NFT being burned.
Ensure that the NFT belongs to an integrated collection with configured rewards.
Burn the NFT, removing it permanently from circulation.
Issue the corresponding reward to the NFT owner's wallet.

### User Interface for Burning and Rewards:
 A user-friendly interface that allows NFT owners to view eligible rewards, select NFTs for burning, and claim their rewards. This interface will also display detailed transaction histories and the status of claimed rewards.

### Environmental Variables and Configuration:
 Use of environmental variables and configuration files to customize the DApp for different NFT collections and reward schemes. This allows for easy scalability and adaptation to various use cases and collection sizes.

### Automated Background Processes:
 Background services for monitoring the state of the reward pool, processing reward claims, and managing the lifecycle of rewards (e.g., expiration and renewal).

### Community Engagement Tools:
Features to encourage community participation and engagement, such as leaderboards, burning challenges, and social sharing options.


Additional Ideas:

Collaborative Events: Enable collaboration between different NFT collections for special burning events, where burning NFTs from participating collections yields unique, cross-collection rewards.
