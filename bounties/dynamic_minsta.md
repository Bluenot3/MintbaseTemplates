# Dynamic Minsta: Badge Evolution for Multi-Event Participation


The goal of this bounty is to enhance the Minsta application to support dynamic NFT badges that evolve as users participate in a series of five distinct events within a campaign. The goal is to incentivize full participation across all events, with the NFT badges evolving to signify user engagement, culminating in eligibility for special rewards for those who achieve the final evolution stage.

## Functionality

### Campaign and Event Configuration:

Provide the capability for campaign organizers to set up and configure a series of five events through environment variables or a configuration file in their application deployment. This setup should include unique identifiers, event names, and durations.
Integration with Mintbase 

### NFT Contract:

Utilize the existing NFT contract on Mintbase for creating and managing the NFT badges. Ensure the application is configured to interact with this contract for minting and updating NFTs, with a focus on adding metadata that reflects participation in each event.

### Dynamic NFT Evolution Mechanism:

Implement logic to dynamically evolve the NFT badges as users participate in events. This involves updating the NFT's metadata and possibly its visual representation on Mintbase after participation in each event. The evolution stages should be clearly defined, with the final stage representing participation in all five events.

### User Participation Tracking:

Develop a system within the application to track user participation in each event. This could involve checking in users via the app when they mint a photo at an event and recording this activity against their user profile and NFT metadata.

### Evolution Criteria and Rewards:

Define specific criteria for NFT evolution, detailing how participation in each event contributes to the badge's evolution. Outline the rewards for users whose NFTs reach the final evolution stage, emphasizing the benefits of full participation.

### Frontend Interface Enhancements:

Update the Minsta application's user interface to allow users to view the current evolution stage of their NFT badge, upcoming events, and their participation status. This interface should motivate and inform users about their progress and the remaining requirements for the next evolution stage.

### Documentation and Setup Guide:

Provide detailed documentation for campaign organizers on how to deploy their customized version of the application, set up events, and configure integration with the Mintbase NFT contract. Include guidance on managing the campaign and supporting users throughout the event series.
