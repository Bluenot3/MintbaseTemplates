# AI-Chat

AI-Chat is a Next.js project that provides a chat interface with AI capabilities. It uses the Mintbase Wallet for user authentication and the OpenAI GPT-4 model for generating chat responses.

## Setup

To get started with the project, you need to install the dependencies first. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
pnpm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```
pnpm run dev
```

Then, open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.


### Environment Variables

⚠️ Beta: We are still working on a solution to issue Mintbase API keys for using the Mintbase AI Router.

Checkout `.env.example` and create a local env file (`.env.local`) with:

```
MB_API_KEY=
```
