## Contributing

  

You can send us your dapp project using Mintbase.js and be showcased here.

All you have to do is open a P/R with the project inside a folder.

We use Next.js 14 as the standard framework, but other frameworks/libs using mintbase.js are welcomed.

  

### Branching

 **Main branch**

This is the default branch and will be equal the latest official release.

 **Dev Branch**

This is the branch for development used by the team and/or other contributors from the community. New features, fixes and other improvements are first implemented and tested in this branch. When adding new features/fixes team members must always create a new branch locally based on latest changes of dev branch. When your work is ready a merge request should be opened from your branch to dev. When your PR is reviewed and approved then it can be merged.

 **Other branches**

Except main and dev branch other branches are work in progress by the team or related to the open PR(s).

### Criteria
 1. A new template to be accepted, need not to current exist
 2. It should have an original code (not be copied)
 3. New implementations of already existing template ( in other technologies ) are welcomed.
