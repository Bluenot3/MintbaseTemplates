## Contributing

  

You can send us your dapp project using Mintbase.js and be showcased here.

All you have to do is open a P/R with the project inside a folder.

We use Next.js 14 as the standard framework, but other frameworks/libs using mintbase.js are welcomed.

  

### Branching

 **Main branch**

This is the default branch and will be equal the latest official release.

 **Dev Branch**

This is the branch for development used by the team and/or other contributors from the community. New features, fixes and other improvements are first implemented and tested in this branch. When adding new features/fixes team members must always create a new branch locally based on latest changes of dev branch. When your work is ready a merge request should be opened from your branch to dev. When your PR is reviewed and approved then it can be merged.

 **Other branches**

Except main and dev branch other branches are work in progress by the team or related to the open PR(s).

### Criteria
 1. For a template to be accepted, it does not need to currently exist.
 2. It should feature original code and not be copied from existing sources.
 3. We welcome new implementations of templates in different technologies, even if they are based on existing templates.
