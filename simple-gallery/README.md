[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMintbase%2Fexamples%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fsimple-gallery)


## Getting Started

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/tree/main/simple-gallery
# or
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/tree/main/simple-gallery
```


Run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn
yarn dev
```

Once that's done, copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and set the environment variables to match the ones for your Google Optimize account.
